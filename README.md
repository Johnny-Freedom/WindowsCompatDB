# ExtendWin
Wrappers, Extensions, and Modifications for Windows

.

This is to serve as a **centralization** of patching and compatability for windows, mainly focused on new programs on old windows, it *may* become if microsoft ever breaks something massivly in a release aswell, a database of patching newer systems to run older stuff aswell, but this is focused on older systems.

Please, contribute, You can add program tests in the `Programs` directory.
And you can add extenders in the `Extenders` directory.

NOTE: This github is only to hold information, **not code**, tho, code may be linked to in another repositori or website

Please, do not be whinny, no one wants to listen.

You may add stuff in Issues tab aswell to bring it to light, but also add your testing results to the repo.
